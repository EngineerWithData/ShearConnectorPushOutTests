title: Shear Connectors Welded Through Steel Deck Database
about:
    - The objective of this project is to parse the existing testing data into subsets in order to examine if higher available strength is available in specific subsets.
    - AISC 360-22 specifically permits a performance-based alternative for the design of shear connectors.
    - 551 push-out test data for shear studs installed through steel deck is established from the literature.
    - The database can be used for data and reliability analysis of shear connectors.
    - The vertical axis represents the stud strength normalized by the nominal resistance specified in AISC 360.
